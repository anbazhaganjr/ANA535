Paragraph
"Over the next decade (2025–2035), the US Manufacturing Total index is projected to grow from 114 in 2024 to approximately 118.9, reflecting a steady growth rate driven by historical trends (1948–2025). The UK Manufacturing Total index, based on historical trends (1948–2024), is expected to rise from 104.5 to around 112.5. The US is likely to maintain its lead in industrial output, supported by a larger, more diversified industrial base."
